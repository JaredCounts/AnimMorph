# AnimMorph

Implementation of Chen, Weber, Keren, and Ben-Chen's "Planar Shape Interpolation with Bounded Distortion." Plus some contributions, eventually.

## Todo
* Add toggleable 2D mode to Camera
* Move all mouse-related functionality to static functions in Mouseable
* Texturing
* Would be nice if we shared libraries with my other project (e.g., Camera, Mouseable, etc. were copy pasted from elsewhere)
* Sort things out in their own directories
* Separate window logic from loop logic
* Actually implement the paper!
